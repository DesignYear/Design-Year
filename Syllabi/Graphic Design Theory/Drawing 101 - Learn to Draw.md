> All the elements of design are rooted in drawing, as is painting. Drawing is the fundamental skill of visual artists of any stripe. The better we draw, the better we paint, and the better we design, because drawing contains all the problems and pitfalls we must overcome as designers. If we never fully deal with the problems with a pencil, we never fully solve our graphic design issues with much cruder tools.

### Course Description

Drawing is the foundation of great design.  Putting pen to paper is the first step in the realization of any idea!  We will start our journey with learning to draw.

You will learn to:

- Learn proper methods to draw
- Give and receive constructive critiques
- Use group resources to work collaboratively and to iterate extensively

Simply stated, then, my goal in Drawing 101 is to help you better communicate and solve problems through drawing.

Drawing is an acquired skill, not a talent--anyone can learn to draw. All you need is a pencil, a piece of paper, and the willingness to tap into your hidden artistic abilities.

### Course Goals

Drawing 101, you will have the opportunity to:

1) complete 30 drawing lessons
2) reflect on your own processes of drawing;
3) set appropriate goals for improving your drawing skills and devise effective plans for achieving those goals;
4) contribute your voice to critical conversations already in progress;
5) learn how to give and take constructive critique of writing in progress;
6) collaborate with peers to define revision strategies for particular drawing pieces;
7) focus on revision as a creative and intellectual process.

### A Note on Plagiarism

When you cheat in this course, you are just cheating yourself out of an opportunity to learn and grow as a designer.

If you are going to steal then steal like an artist ;-)

### Finally

Finally, I look forward to working with you this semester. Don’t hesitate to let me know if you have questions—that’s often the only way I know that I need to be more clear. Please see me or email me if you require special accommodations due to learning disabilities, religious practices, physical requirements, medical needs, or any other reasons.
