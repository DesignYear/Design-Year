# Design Year
#### *An Invitation to Create*

As each year comes to a close, the new year brings an opportunity for a blank canvas when it come to goals and resolutions.

One of my goals for this upcoming year is to **“Learn Design”**.

How can one accomplish this… [Without going to Design School](http://www.karenx.com/blog/how-to-become-a-designer-without-going-to-design-school/)?
