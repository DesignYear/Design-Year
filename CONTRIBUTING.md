We love new ideas that push this repository and design sprints forward. We are using [GitHub issues](https://github.com/designyear/design-year/issues/) for tracking our work on the repository. Here are the ways that you can contribute:

## Maintenance and Improvements

If you find a bug, misspelling or other problem with the repository please add a new [issue](https://github.com/designyear/design-year/issues/new).

If you are looking to contribute and are not sure where to start: 

1. Grab an issue from the list of [issues labeled bug](https://github.com/designyear/design-year/labels/bug) and assign yourself to the issue so that we know someone is working on it. 
2. Make the necessary changes.
3. Submit a [Pull Request](#quick-guide-to-submitting-a-pull-request-in-github).

# New Ideas

Any new ideas or major improvements can be added to a PR so that they can be discussed and tested. 

# Quick guide to submitting a Pull Request in GitHub:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Make your changes in a topic branch.
3. Squash your commits into a single one (more on that [here](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html)).
4. Rebase against `origin/master`, push to your fork and submit a pull request.
