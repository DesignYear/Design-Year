# The Plan

####* Bookending Your Days*

>“You’re the first thing I think of when I wake up and the last thing when I go to sleep. You’re my sun and moon and stars, my past and present-and I hope you’ll be my future.” — A.G. Henley, The Scourge

In college, I wanted to learn to be a DJ and a friend told me to practice daily for 15 minutes when I woke up and 15 minutes before I went to sleep.

*Long story short…*

Within 1 year, I was able to DJ parties at clubs and even won a Talent Show for performing a remixed acoustic cover of [“Ants Marching” by Dave Matthews Band](https://youtu.be/IXPOHCsgWFw) (1 Guitar Player + 1 Sax Player + 1 DJ Scratching).

The secret to my accelerated progression was consistency.
